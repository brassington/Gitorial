# GitHuborial #
  > For Github repo developers who want to quickly share how to use their APIs.

## Summary ##
  > This project allows any project in a Github repository to provide a set of questions and answers in a TeachMe.md file, that can take some of the most commonly used parts of your repository and introduce them in an easy way without a lot of explanation. This will help developers quickly quiz themselves in a gentle, introductory fashion helpful for picking up someone else's code for the first time. It is a very interactive, prompt and response-type way of learning.

## Problem ##
  > It's difficult to quickly learn the variety of API's available as projects on Github. What would it be like to have the developer coach you as an introduction to their code?

## Solution ##
  > Githuborial gives your developers a quick way to positively interact with your API, to learn how you intend it to be used, from the most simple examples to increasingly difficult concepts. You, the author, write a series of questions meant to guide your users to enlightenment about how to use your code.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Write a repo yourself, and checkout what format you can create your TeachMe.md in so that a gentle tutorial is created from your markdown file.
